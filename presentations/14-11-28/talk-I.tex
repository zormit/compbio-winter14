% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\section{Problem Description}

\begin{frame}{Structure Prediction with contact restraints}{Background}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Goal: secondary $\rightarrow$ tertiary
    \item Use of contact points reduces complexity of search space
\end{itemize}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{contact_prediction}\footnote{from Schneider, Brock -- 
Combining Physicochemical and Evolutionary
Information for Protein Contact Prediction}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Structure Prediction with contact restraints}{Pipeline}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Get restraints as input
    % explain contact restraints: 8Ã…
    \item Update energy function
    % show on whiteboard
    \item Run Monte Carlo with Metropolis Criterion
\end{enumerate}
$\Rightarrow$ \emph{guided search}, cf. MBS/MIMIC
%The search is thus guided by employment of the information from the constraints. In what way is this \emph{guiding} comparable to methods in MBS or MIMIC?
\end{frame}

\section{Improve the use of noisy restraints}

\begin{frame}{Improve the use of noisy restraints}{Problem}
How to make use of predicted restraints?
\begin{itemize}
    \item source of information! $\rightarrow$ reliability?
    \item tradeoff between \emph{exploration} and \emph{exploitation}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Improve the use of noisy restraints}{Approach}
\begin{itemize}
    \item compatibility of restraints
    \item heuristics to group restraints
    \begin{itemize}
        \item use secondary structure
        \item use distance on primary structure
        % Show sketches on board
    \end{itemize}
    \item exploratory parameter analysis
    % compare with ground truth
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Planning}

\begin{frame}{Project Timeline}
\begin{itemize}
\item project runs for 8 weeks: 48 -- 3
\item kickoff: today (Week 48)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item implement restraint grouping
    \end{itemize}
\item milestone I: 12. December (Week 50)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item optimize use of restraints
    \item evaluate and compare algorithms
    \end{itemize}
\item milestone II: 9th January (Week 2)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item create poster, analyze results
    \end{itemize}
\item final poster session: 15th January (Week 3)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
